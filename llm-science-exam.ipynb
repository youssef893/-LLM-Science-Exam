It’s more efficient to dynamically pad the sentences to the longest length in a batch during collation, instead of padding the whole dataset to the maximum length\n\n\nHere's the reformatted text with headings and bullet points for clarity:\n\n---\n\n**Code Explanation: Data Collator for Multiple-Choice Tasks**\n\nThis code defines a data collator class for multiple-choice tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library. A data collator is used to process and prepare data for model training. In multiple-choice tasks, the model must choose the correct answer from a set of options for a given question or prompt. The data collator is responsible for dynamically padding and formatting the input data for these tasks. Here's an explanation of the code:\n\n**Importing Necessary Modules:**\n\n- The code imports various modules and classes from the Transformers library, including dataclasses for creating structured data classes, PreTrainedTokenizerBase for tokenization, and some types for function annotations.\n\n**DataCollatorForMultipleChoice Data Class:**\n\n- This class is defined as a dataclass using the @dataclass decorator. Dataclasses are a convenient way to define classes that are primarily used to store data.\n\n**Constructor:**\n\n- The constructor (__init__ method) takes the following arguments:\n  - `tokenizer`: A tokenizer object for tokenizing the input data.\n  - `padding`: An optional argument specifying the padding strategy. It can be a boolean (True or False), a string, or a PaddingStrategy object.\n  - `max_length`: An optional argument specifying the maximum length of the padded input data.\n  - `pad_to_multiple_of`: An optional argument specifying the padding to a multiple of a given value.\n\n**__call__ Method:**\n\n- This method is called when an instance of the DataCollatorForMultipleChoice class is invoked.\n- It takes a list of features as input, where each feature is a dictionary containing information related to multiple-choice questions and their options.\n- It extracts the labels from each feature and populates them into a separate list called labels.\n- It computes the batch size and the number of choices (options) in each question.\n- It flattens the features to create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to one choice for each question.\n- It uses the tokenizer to pad and format the flattened features based on the specified padding strategy, maximum length, and pad_to_multiple_of value.\n- It returns a batch of data with the following components:\n  - `input_ids`: Padded input IDs for each choice.\n  - `attention_mask`: Padded attention masks.\n  - `token_type_ids`: Padded token type IDs (usually not relevant for multiple-choice tasks).\n  - `labels`: The labels for the correct choices.\n\nThis data collator is designed to work with the Transformers library, especially for multiple-choice tasks, where you have a list of questions, each with multiple choices, and you want to prepare the data for training a model that can choose the correct answer from these choices. The collator ensures that all inputs are padded and formatted correctly for training.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom transformers.tokenization_utils_base import PreTrainedTokenizerBase, PaddingStrategy\nfrom typing import Optional, Union\nimport torch\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataCollatorForMultipleChoice:\n    \"\"\"\n    Data collator that dynamically pads the inputs for multiple choice questions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Constructor\n    tokenizer: PreTrainedTokenizerBase\n    padding: Union[bool, str, PaddingStrategy] = True\n    max_length: Optional[int] = None\n    pad_to_multiple_of: Optional[int] = None\n\n    def __call__(self, features):\n        # Determine the label name based on the presence of 'label' or 'labels'\n        label_name = \"label\" if 'label' in features[0].keys() else 'labels'\n        \n        # Extract and remove labels from features\n        labels = [feature.pop(label_name) for feature in features]\n        \n        # Compute batch size and number of choices\n        batch_size = len(features)\n        num_choices = len(features[0]['input_ids'])\n        \n        # Flatten the features to create a list of dictionaries\n        flattened_features = [\n            [{k: v[i] for k, v in feature.items()} for i in range(num_choices)] for feature in features\n        ]\n        \n        # Combine the flattened features into a single list\n        flattened_features = sum(flattened_features, [])\n        \n        # Use the tokenizer to pad and format the features\n        batch = self.tokenizer.pad(\n            flattened_features,\n            padding=self.padding,\n            max_length=self.max_length,\n            pad_to_multiple_of=self.pad_to_multiple_of,\n            return_tensors='pt',\n        )\n        \n        # Reshape the batch\n        batch = {k: v.view(batch_size, num_choices, -1) for k, v in batch.items()}\n        \n        # Create a tensor for labels\n        batch['labels'] = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.int64)\n        \n        return batch\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.725579Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.725887Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.736918Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.725862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.735949Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":179,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The arguments here are selected to run quickly; feel free to play with them.\nmodel_dir = 'finetuned_bert'\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=model_dir,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    save_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    load_best_model_at_end=True,\n    learning_rate=5e-5,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=4,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,\n    num_train_epochs=3,\n    weight_decay=0.01,\n    report_to='none'\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.738047Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.738342Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.756862Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.738294Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.755815Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":180,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Generally it's a bad idea to validate on your training set, but because our training set\n# for this problem is so small we're going to train on all our data.\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=tokenized_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=tokenized_train_ds,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    data_collator=DataCollatorForMultipleChoice(tokenizer=tokenizer),\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.758131Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.758456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.890927Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.758426Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.890075Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":181,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training should take about a minute\ntrainer.train()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.892106Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.892381Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-23T21:11:48.359348Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-23T21:10:58.892357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-23T21:11:48.358430Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":182,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"You're using a BertTokenizerFast tokenizer.
